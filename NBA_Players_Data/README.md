This is a personal project for SQL practice. I made AI-generated questions about the dataset and answered them.
The data set contains the 1996 to 2022 season on each player who has been part of an NBA teams' roster. It captures demographic variables such as age, height, weight and place of birth, biographical details like the team played for, draft year and round. In addition, it has basic box score statistics such as games played, average number of points, rebounds, assists, etc.
